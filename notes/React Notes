notes for React: component takes in parameters called props (properties) and returns 
a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
Render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React is what
takes the description and displays the result. Render returns a react element.
App.js is used to create a component.
styles.css is used to define the styles for your react app.
index.js is the bridge between the component in App.js and the web browser.
